# placesbrands-homepage
this is my attempt to redesign the existing homepage for placesbrands dot com and make it responsive
after struggling with heavy and bloated wordpress themes like avada etc, I decided to have a go at building up my desired page from scratch using html/css.
this is the old site www.placesbrands.com
